There are blog posts available describing key features of the library (some of them have been written in context of ASP.NET MVC 5 but the core idea haven't changed):

- [Content Security Policy in ASP.NET MVC](http://tpeczek.blogspot.com/2015/06/content-security-policy-in-aspnet-mvc.html) (How ContentSecurityPolicyAttribute and ContentSecurityPolicyExtensions work)
